    "In computer science a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that consists of a set of instructions that takes an array as input, manipulates it using specified operations, and outputs a sorted array generally in numerical order (1). The algorithm takes the input array and outputs a permutation of the array that has been sorted. Sorting algorithms are very important for other computational algorithms to work efficiently like merge and search algorithms(2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first sorting algorithm that was created was bubble sort in 1956 with Betty Holbertong being the pioneer of sorting algorithms in 1951. It was recognized by the early computer scientists that stable and reusable sorting algorithms would play an important role in the future of computer science(2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms can be divided up into comparison sorts and integer sorts. Comparison sorts compare elements at each step of the algorithm to identify if one element should be to the left or right of another element(3).Comparison sorts are generally easier to implement than integer sorts, but comparison sorts are limited by a lower bound of O(nlogn). A comparison sort can be modeled as a large binary tree called a decision tree where each node represents a single comparison (3). At every subsequent level of the tree you divide problem into half and do constant amount of additional work. O(log N) is found when time goes up linearly while the input goes up exponentially(4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Integer sorts work differently and do not make comparisons, so they are not bounded by Ω(nlogn). Integer sorts determine for each element X how many elements are less than X and work through the array in that fashion (3). This information is used to place each element into the correct slot immediately—no need to rearrange lists.The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms(5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting algorithms can be identified through their time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity is how fast the algorithm runs and is estimated by counting the number of elemenary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each individual operation takes a fixed amount of time to run(6). The running time of a sorting algorithm is measured in terms of big O, and not Omega. For example, if an algorithm had a worst-case running time of O(nlogn), then it is understood that the algorithm will never be slower than O(nlogn), and if an algorithm has an average-case running time of O(n2)O(n2), then on average, it will not be slower than O(n2)O(n2) (7). The better the time complexity of an algorithm is, the faster the algorithm will carry out his work in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity is the number of memory cells which an algorithm needs to perform it's operation. A good algorithm keeps this number as small as possible. There is often a time-space-tradeoff involved in choosing the algorithm as in general problems cannot be solved with low computing time and low memory consumption (8). One then has to make a decision and to choose computing time for memory consumption or vice versa.  For example, insertion sort has a space complexity of O(1), because it doesn't need extra allocation of memory in order to sort the provided collection. In this case we say that the sorting operation is done in-place(8). In place sorting is modifying the given list by only changing the element order in the existing list. This saves on memory and is very space efficient.\n",
    "Merge sort is different, and it has a space complexity of O(n). Merge sort recursively divides the array in two  creating a new array at each step. The sorting operation requires the allocation of new space in memory. This obviously requires extra RAM and storage(9).   "
